They look amazing in my study, and the shelves themselves show no signs of bowing under the weight of the vinyl. Finish is a rich, almost-black brown, and easy to wipe clean.

       "  \"Just what I was looking for. I was looking for a way to store the various bits and pieces for different projects I am working on in my studio. My usual method was to have a pile somewhere, and add to that pile. Of course, the piles would spill into each other, and eventually became more knitting projects pile and sewing projects pile instead of Knitting Project for Customer A, Knitting Project for Customer B, Sewing Project for Customer C, Sewing project for Customer D. I also wanted a low credenza-like shelf to add work surfaces to the studio, as well. Other, similar products from other companies looked the same online, but were considerably smaller in dimensions. When turned on its side, the KALLAX is a nice height at 30 inches. The whole unit is very heavy, strong, and sturdy. I am very pleased with it.  As far as how well it works for my original needs: I can now see, at a glance, each project and its materials. When new pieces (fabric orders, button orders, new patterns) come in, I can just toss each item into its appropriate cubby, and it is not in danger of intermingling with other projects or getting lost somewhere special where I put it so I wouldn't misplace it. (You know how that goes.) Additionally, the top of the unit turned out to work very nicely as a place to mount my yarn swift, yardage gauge, baller, and scale, resulting in a very effective yarn winding station that remains out of my way, even while set up. The flat-packed package did require two people to move (as, I assume, will the final piece of furniture), but I was able to assemble it easily by myself. Everything turned out nicely square and solid.  I bought the black-brown finish. My studio has a black and white motif, and though this is not a true black, it is close enough to blend nicely with the rest of the room. It really looks more like a wood with a black stain (there is a wood-grain pattern to the finish). The unit is not solid wood, but a composite wood product, but the finish looks very wood-like.\",\n",

I was hoping it would be slightly smaller like one of the comments said but yes it was exact size so I had a little bit of trouble putting it into the closet but when I got it in omg. My stuff has been so organized since no more mess or digging through boxes to find my clothes. I love that I’m able to now stuck my clothes in the bins and have each individual been separate for clothes. It’s also worth the money because My friend suggested to just buy individual squares and put my bins in but they’re normally around $20 each and if I got 8 of them you would be paying over $180 easily that way. But this only $69 and with bins it was like $110. I also love that I can customize this into cabinets or doors later on if I wanted to.',\n",

I agree with other reviews that the quality has declined to the point of being cheap China quality. The pressed wood is in big chunks and splits easily. I would recommend to predrill holes for safer installation. Once it splits, it just keeps going and will fall apart. Mine was damaged straight from the package and since it was a weight bearing piece there was no way to get around it and it had to be returned. Then to my surprise it was discontinued. I am so unhappy and then supplies are hard to get so nothing much else is available if you want to customize it with inserts in one shopping trip. \",\n",

As some one who tried to, I only got 100 feet. I struggled the entire way, I then found a shopping cart, managed to get it in there, then had to push the cart into my car on the loading dock to get the box in there. It was a horrendous experience that was WELL worth it. Also the people who work at Ikea are so friendly but if you go on a Sunday in the late evening, don’t expect any carts because customers don’t return them, so get it before you start through ikea.',\n",
       "  \"Awesome!. Buy it from IKEA directly (store) for just $65. Also the quality is great! However if you've never hammered anything in your life or haven't ever assembled anything, have an iPhone or are technology illiterate, then this isn't for you.\",\n",
       "  \"used to be good. This was our third Kallax unit to buy - we liked the first two and with a move to a new house, we thought one more would fit just fine. And it did. But. This time the quality was not as good as before. One of the edges wasn't glued properly and was afar from the body right out of the box. I don't know how to avoid this. I definitely won't take the unit apart and drive it back to the IKEA store another 50 miles just to replace the defective part. But it's not even an option to open the box and check all the parts in the store... So... The product is fine but just be prepared for lowering quality. I really hope it's not a trend for IKEA but just my bad luck.\",\n",
       "  'Terrible delivery service. This isn’t a dig against the product, which overall is great. But rather an expression of my extreme disappointment in IKEA’s delivery methods and customer service. It took well over a month to have a shelf unit delivered to my house after serval terminal delays and the fact the delivery company forgot to load my order onto a truck several times. Both IKEA and the delivery company were indifferent and unwilling to help. I guess all I can say is buy this item in store if you’re serious about owning it in a reasonable timeframe.',\n",

Most of us understand what we\\'re getting with Ikea and why--the price is affordable, and a little sweat, frustration etc. in putting things with names like \"wood-effect\" together is expected. But holy sweet baby cheesus this was a beast. Whatever newfangled idea they had with the allen wrench is BAD. Mine barely fit the screws and two of them will still not go in all the way, making the drawers I put in (or attempted to put in) also not fit correctly. I could close the drawer all the way if I used a hammer lol. Luckily I had another allen wrench from some previous project and finally thought to use it, and it fit the screws much better, otherwise this piece of furniture would not even be remotely put together.

My husband put them together at the same time and we were SHOCKED to see that the other brand was a better quality, sturdier installation method, etc. The $5 savings doesn't even come close to being worth it, and that's before factoring in the other one will deliver to your house.\",\n",

The holes where the screws go show on both sides, and ikea doesn’t offer anything to put over the screw holes. I even went back and asked if there was anything I could buy at ikea to cover the screw holes, and they referred me to go to Home Depot! Not good!
